        <h2>Life before baseball</h2>
        <p>Born on February 6, 1895 in Baltimore, Maryland to parents Kate and George Ruth Sr, George Herman Ruth Jr. would change baseball forever.  
        He was one of 8 children in the family, but one of 2 surviors with his sister being the other one.  Because his were parents were busy with 
        providing for the family and wasn't able give guidance, George Jr. would often get into trouble.  
        By the time he was 7 years old, he was sent St. Mary's Industrial School so that he could have more stability and discipline in his life.  
        This was where he learned not only vocational skills, but was where his passion for baseball was born.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" id="card3">
        <h2>The passion begins</h2>
        <p>One of the members of the school deemed Brother Mathias saw George's potential and trained him in all aspects of baseball.  
        Eventually George got so good at hitting, fielding, and pitching, that the school invited the owner fo the Baltimore Orioles, Jack Dunn, to watch George play baseball.
        Once Jack saw George's skills, he offered him a contract in February 1914.  Before he could play for the team, 
        George needed a legal guardian to finish the contract, because he was only 19 at the time.  So Dunn became his Guardian.  
        Once the other players of the team saw George Jr. for the first time, they refered him to as "Jack's newest babe".  
        Thus, George Herman Ruth Jr. would famously be known as Babe Ruth.

        <h2>Babe starts his official career</h2>
        <p>Babe Ruth had perfomed exceptionally well for the Orioles, which would eventually lead him into the Boston Red Socks.  
        Before he became famous for his powerful hits, he was an excellent pitcher.  In 1914, he made his winning debut in the major league 
        on July 11, 1914.   However, since the official roster was overloaded, he was sent to the minor leagues equivilant to the Red Socks, 
        Through the past few seasons, Babe would consistently having impressive stats and showing excellent and powerful hitting despite his limited apperances.  So much so, that 
        he was far too good to keep him off the lineup constantly.  So in 1918, he became an everyday player.  This led him to setting a single-season 
        homerun record of 29 dingers in 1919.  It would be his last season with the Boston Red Socks, with him being sold to the New York Yankees 
        on December 26, 1919.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" id="card5">
        <h2>His time in the Yankees</h2>
        <p>Babe Ruth had an astonishing career with his time in the Yankees.  He became their right fielder and began rewriting the record books when it comes 
        to hitting.  As the matter of fact, in his 1921 season, he set a record of 59 homeruns, drove 171 RBIs, scored 177 runs, and batted a .376 with an .846 
        slugging percentage.  Because of this outstanding season, scientists wanted to study him to find out the secret to his hitting prowess.  
        They found that on top of his sizable build, his senses and nerve system were higher than the average man.  Going back to baseball, he and the rest of the Yankees 
        moved to a new stadium in 1923, and dubbed it "The House that Ruth Built".  With his time with the Yankees, they had won seven pennants and four World Series 
        titles.  In one of those World Series games, 1932 to be precise, he would peformed his most famous homerun in his career.  He pointed at centerfield, predicting where he would 
        hit his homerun.  He then proceeds to hit said homerun, just as he predicted.  This would go on to be imitated time and time again.
        </p>

        <h2>Last baseball days before retirement</h2>
        <p>Babe Ruth would go on breaking even more records, including 714 homeruns by the end of his career in baseball.  He went on tour to Japan with an all-star baseball 
        team in 1934.  They would travel to 12 cities and play 22 games in just 10 days.  Once back in America, Babe would spend the rest of his career playing for the Boston Braves.  
        In 1935, Babe Ruth had retired from playing baseball.  In 1936, Babe Ruth was one of the first five baseball players to be 
        inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

        <h2>Final Days</h2>
        <p>In the fall of 1946, a tumor was discovered on the back of Babe Ruth's neck.  Thus, leading a fast perpetual decline in his health.  During his final days, his jersey number "3" was retired
         on June 13, 1948.  This is when he made his last appearance at the Yankee Stadium alive.  On August 16, 1948, he had died of cancer.  His body was shown lying in the Yankee stadium, with the 
        funeral taking place a few days later at St. Patrick's Cathedral where over 100,000 people showed to pay respects to the Babe.  He may have passed on from this life, but his legacy lives
        on.</p>
